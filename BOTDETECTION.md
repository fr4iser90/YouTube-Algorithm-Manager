## 🔥 High-Risk Actions (Ban Likely)

| Action                                                             | Risk Level   | Why It's Dangerous                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Auto-viewing your own videos (view bots)**                       | 🔥 Very High | YouTube detects view manipulation through patterns, IPs, and user agents. Can lead to immediate ban. |
| **Auto-liking/commenting on videos**                               | 🔥 Very High | Especially if repeated across multiple videos or accounts — triggers spam detection.                 |
| **Auto-watching other channels to “boost” them**                   | 🔥 Very High | Repeated, scripted, or coordinated viewing is flagged as artificial traffic.                         |
| **Using bots (headless/API) to interact (like/comment/subscribe)** | 🔥 Very High | YouTube tracks bot-like behavior through the API, rate-limits, and browser fingerprinting.           |
| **Click farms or proxy-based view networks**                       | 🔥 Extreme   | YouTube has advanced detection systems for this. Risk of account, IP, and device bans.               |

## ⚠️ Medium-Risk / Gray Area

| Action                                                           | Risk Level | Explanation                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A/B testing thumbnails/titles with multiple private accounts** | ⚠️ Medium  | Acceptable if done manually and naturally. Bots or automation = risky. |
| **Sharing your video across multiple forums quickly**            | ⚠️ Medium  | Can be okay — but flagged if spammy or too frequent from same IPs.     |

## ✅ Safe / Allowed Automation

| Action                                               | Risk Level | Why It’s Safe                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scheduling uploads automatically**                 | ✅ Safe     | YouTube offers built-in tools for this. Totally fine.                 |
| **Optimizing metadata (titles, tags, descriptions)** | ✅ Safe     | Using tools like TubeBuddy, vidIQ, etc. is acceptable and encouraged. |
| **Using analytics to guide content strategy**        | ✅ Safe     | Monitoring watch time, retention, and CTR is good practice.           |
| **Using YouTube’s API for legit content analytics**  | ✅ Safe     | Allowed within quota — avoid abuse.                                   |

## 🧠 Key Rules to Follow

1. **Never fake engagement** (views, likes, comments).
2. **Don't use multiple accounts to simulate interaction** — especially not in patterns.
3. **Avoid using public view-exchange websites** — these are almost always flagged.
4. **Use automation only for safe tasks** like scheduling, analytics, metadata.
5. **Organic growth beats fake growth** — manipulated traffic actually **hurts** your channel long term.
