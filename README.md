## üìã Overview
This project is a browser extension that helps users filter YouTube content based on custom keyword lists, clickbait detection, and machine learning. It allows users to create and manage presets for different filtering configurations and train the algorithm for better content filtering.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
The application is built using a modern React-based architecture with the following key components:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, using Vite as the build tool.
- **State Management**: Local state management with React hooks and localStorage for persistence.
- **Browser Extension**: A Chrome extension that filters YouTube content in real-time.
- **Communication**: Cross-domain communication between the web app and the extension using localStorage and Chrome Messages.
- **Machine Learning**: Local training system for improving content filtering.

## üõ†Ô∏è Techstack
- **Frontend**:
  - React
  - TypeScript
  - Vite
  - Framer Motion (for animations)
  - Lucide React (for icons)
- **Browser Extension**:
  - Chrome Extension API
  - Content Scripts
  - Background Scripts
- **Storage**:
  - localStorage (for preset data)
  - sessionStorage (for temporary data)
  - IndexedDB (for training data)
