# YouTube Algorithm Manager

## 📋 Overview
This project is a web application designed to train and manage YouTube's recommendation algorithm using a browser extension. It allows users to create custom presets, save profiles, and interact with YouTube in real-time to influence their recommendations.

## 🏗️ Architecture
The application is built using a modern React-based architecture with the following key components:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, using Vite as the build tool.
- **State Management**: Local state management with React hooks and localStorage for persistence.
- **Browser Extension**: A Chrome extension that interacts with YouTube to perform real-time training.
- **Communication**: Cross-domain communication between the web app and the extension using localStorage, BroadcastChannel, and Chrome Messages.

## 🛠️ Techstack
- **Frontend**:
  - React
  - TypeScript
  - Vite
  - Framer Motion (for animations)
  - Lucide React (for icons)
- **Browser Extension**:
  - Chrome Extension API
  - Content Scripts
  - Background Scripts
- **Storage**:
  - localStorage (for profile and preset data)
  - sessionStorage (for temporary data)
- **Communication**:
  - BroadcastChannel
  - Chrome Messages
  - localStorage
